// Verbal Questions

// 1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

// Answer: a parameter is a variable or placeholder that's meant to signify what type of data should be passed into the function when it is called. An argument is a piece of data that is passed into the function when it is called (in a sense, "replacing" the placeholder parameter).  

// Parameter example: function fakeFunction(num) {...}
// Argument example: fakeFunction(40)

// 2. Within a function, what is the difference between return and console.log?

// Answer: a console.log merely prints whatever data is passed as its argument (usually for testing purposes) while a return actually passes the data value that the called function is meant to produce. That is, a return actually gives the coder access to some value that can then be used in another part of the code.

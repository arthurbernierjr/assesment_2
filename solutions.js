// Verbal questions

// 1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

    // A parameter is a variable that can be passed into a function and it is defined with the function itself. For example, "arr" might be the parameter in a function that reverses an array. An argument is the data that is passed into a function when it is called. In this example, [1,2,3] would be an argument.

// 2, Within a function, what is the difference between return and console.log?

    // A return ends a function with the object following it. Console.log doesn't end a function, but prints the argument in the console.
